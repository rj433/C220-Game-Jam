# C220-Game-Jam
Game Jam for MSCH-C220, April 2021

## Theme:We interpreted the theme as a place where many people who go into the castle have died, so you take their keys to proceed through the level, making every death count.

## Gameplay: Objective-Find three rooms with three keys and overcome the final boss to win the game. Instructions- There are three rooms on every level with a key. You cannot proceed without every key. Then at the end there is a boss. After that you can use all your keys to win the game. 

## Impediments-Something we were struggling with for a good bit was coding player animation. For a while we couldn't solve certain problems as it seemed like everytime we solved a problem another would arise. Thankfully we finally figured it all out.

## Implementation-Three levels, with three key rooms, a boss room, and a final room with doors. Tile assets found on Kenney.com. There is also a playable sprite character, multiple wandering enemies, grab-able keys, and dialogue entering a key room. There is a big final boss, background, and music. All of the sprites were used from different free asset websites.
