# Escape from within
Game Jam for MSCH-C220, April 2021

## Theme:We interpreted the theme as a place where many people who go into the castle have died, so you take their keys to proceed through the level, making every death count.

## Gameplay: Objective-Find three rooms with three keys and overcome the final boss to win the game. Instructions- There are three rooms on every level with a key. You cannot proceed without every key. Then at the end there is a boss. After that you can use all your keys to win the game. 
  -Use WASD to move, and Enter to proceed through dialogue

## Impediments-Something we were struggling with for a good bit was coding player animation. For a while we couldn't solve certain problems as it seemed like everytime we solved a problem another would arise. Thankfully we finally figured it all out.
  -Pushing branches back to github and resolving conflicts proved to be confusing
